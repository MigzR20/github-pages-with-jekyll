# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about issues concerning racial injustice, police brutality, criminal justice reform, Black immigration, economic injustice, LGBTQIA+ and human rights, environmental injustice, access to healthcare, access to quality education, and voting rights and suppression.

An organization that is dedicated to these values is BLM
